An Automated System for Monitoring Room Occupancy using IR and Ultrasonic Sensors
This project focuses on building an automated system to monitor the number of people entering and exiting a room using Infrared (IR) and Ultrasonic sensors. The system accurately counts room occupancy in real-time and can be used for smart energy management, security monitoring, and crowd control.

Features:
Real-time person counting using IR sensors.

Distance measurement with Ultrasonic sensors to avoid false counts.

Automatic room occupancy display on an LCD or through serial monitor.

Alerts or controls (optional) like turning on/off lights or fans based on occupancy.

Components Used:
Arduino/ESP32 microcontroller

IR sensors (TX & RX pairs)

Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)

LCD display or serial monitor

Optional: Relay module for controlling appliances

Applications:
Smart home automation

Office and classroom monitoring

Energy-saving systems

Security and crowd management
